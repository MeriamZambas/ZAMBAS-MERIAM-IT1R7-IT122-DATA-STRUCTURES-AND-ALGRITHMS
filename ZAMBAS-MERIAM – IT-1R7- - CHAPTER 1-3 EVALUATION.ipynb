There are two data type which is Built-in data type and derived data type is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support, there are a built-in data type which is integers, Boolean, floating and character and strings. Derived data type is used to states any variable, the example of this data is list, Array, Stack, and Queue. Basic operation is the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure, example Traversing, Searching, Insertion, Sorting and Marching.

      "In this topic of Data Structures and Algorithm Arrays, I learned array that can be used to store data of the same data type. An array is a data Structures that contains a group of elements. Array is it used to store a collection of data. Array for me is very needed, because there’s a lot of data and it is more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. Array representation has element and Index. Element is each item stored in an array is called an element, and the Index is a map the array value to a stored object. The element index is start from 0, if 10 is the value of your Array you should count from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 it’s 9 ends because you include the 0 so index starts from 0 and array length is 10, which is 10 elements, for example I want to access 10 and the Index of 10is 3, but each element can access via index. The important of Array is so much efficient, because It’ll allow you to save so much time and energy especially if you were asked to finish a program at a Short amount of time.\n"
